# Phyloflow
Mockup of user interface for phylogenetic workflows that will translate (and potentially manage the execution of) Snakemake pipelines for phylogenetic analysis.

- Initially use Snakemake tutorial as testbed
  - Lightweight pipeline
  - Initially, translate represent only single tutorial step
  - Steps can represent 'sub-modules' in the eventual build system

## Current objectives

- [ ] Build node graph structure for one tutorial snakemake step
- [ ] Add side-panes to access node properties
- [ ] Add top-pane as a makeshift dashboard
- [ ] Add compile/transcribe, run buttons (non-functional)
- [ ] Get feedback on UX, proposed functionality of mock
- [ ] Resolve build warnings (yarn configuration for react-diagrams)
